This is the best project I have ever finished.
It is a calculator made in tkinter in python 3.8.5. I made it myself and without any tutorials i admit i used stackoverflow but for just one question which was to modify global variables in functions.
Everybody knows what calculator does. This is a simple version of calculator. Meaning it can only add or substract numbers. It can also only add and substract one-digit numbers.
There is probbably much better way of making this but i am proud of this project because i finished it without any tutorials.
I will probbably be improving this as time goes on and as i learn more. But for now this is that calculator.
Code is explained in comments!
It works! Yay!
